# World_Weather_Analysis

### Purpose
The current project is to help Jack recommend a few changes to take the app to the next level. We are recommended to add weather description to the weather data we have already received. Then by using beta testers we will input different statements to filter data for their weather preferences. We are doing this to identify potential travel distinations and nearby hotels. Finally, we will use Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the cities the beta testers choose.
